# Hi there 👋
I'm Json Chicas. I like to use JS(ES6), Reactjs, SASS on my daily basis, just to name the most important bits. I'm a front end developer from Guatemala 🇬🇹.
I love minimalistic design and programming in any shape and form. I strive to learn something new every day and the implement that into either a freelance or a private project.
